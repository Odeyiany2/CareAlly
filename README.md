# CareAlly.
CareAlly is a project developed for the 2024 Google Solutions Challenge. It's a comprehensive solution that leverages the use of mobile technology 
to bridge the knowledge gap between individuals and diseases (Neglected Tropical Dieases) and at the same time providing people with the opportunity to make an impact through supports such as 
donations and volunteering opportunities.
