# CareAlly.
CareAlly is a project developed for the 2024 Google Solutions Challenge. It's a comprehensive solution that leverages the use of mobile technology 
to bridge the knowledge gap between individuals and diseases (Neglected Tropical Dieases) and at the same time providing people with the opportunity to make an impact through supports such as 
donations and volunteering opportunities. Our solution not only focuses on providing awareness and other means to provide support for individuals in need but also aims to provide a means for our users to know more about their health and take the necessary steps to have a healthy lifestyle, easly access medical centers through our map, health podcast and many more.
